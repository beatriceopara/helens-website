          <p>She is vengeance. She is the night. Helen Opara leads a triple life. She is an illustrator, educator and a superhero in training. Drawing since she was a child, she absorbed every single visual aspect of geek and pop culture. Her illustrations are continually inspired by her global experience. Her work has been described as having an overarching theme of struggle through her bold strokes and print technique. Her drive to communicate ideas universally has led her to lead art and design workshops in Spain, England and Italy. She currently lives and works in Bilbao.</p>

            <p>Initially, Helen solely wanted to facilitate and support creativity in people. Her love for drawing never went away and her passion continued to shine through different activities. When she wasnâ€™t attending comic conventions, visiting museums or spending hours in book shops, she presided and led the Art Society. It was a group she co-founded and it was where she got a taste for leading and assisting visual arts activities. It led her to voluntarily taught life drawing classes after university. She also supported and assisted with creative and editorial content for comic book companies Orang Utan Comics and Titan Comics. This ranged from sketching out print layouts, checking and producing ideas to testing websites.</p>

          <p>She soon ventured off to complete an Erasmus year in Amsterdam. It was here that she realised that illustration could become a potential career for her. She experimented with different storytelling ideas and produced a short comic for one of her assignments. Shortly after graduating with a BA in History and Philosophy of Art, she worked in Oxford. She eventually pursued and completed the MDes Comics and Graphic Novels at the University of Dundee. Her drive for vision led her to rediscover printmaking. Woodcutting has been a constant and core part of her image making.</p>

          <p>Her illustrations have been exhibited at several festivals across the U.K. Shortly into her masters, in November 2016, she collaborated with other artists and created live work in a charity live mural at Scots Pride event in Dundee. This was then followed by another event in August 2017. She participated in the Super Yonic festival in London, a celebration and gathering of talented women working in the arts. Recently, she illustrated a coffee infused piece for the London Coffee Art Project; it was then selected and shown at The London Coffee Festival 2019. She is always on the hunt for exciting projects and collaborations. </p>
